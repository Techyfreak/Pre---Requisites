In the previous blog ,we have seen Introduction to Machine Learning. In this session we will try to <br /> 
discover the domain by covering the pre-requisites.

Actually speaking, ML is full of math.Before jumping into this , first i becomes mandatory to know about statistics , probability and <br />
concepts of mathematical functions.Along with this,basic knowledge in programing ,can make our journey more Peacefull!! 

## Pre-Requisites


> Python <br />
> Numpy <br />
> Pandas <br />
> Matplolib pyplot <br />
> Statistics and Probability

## Mathematical Concepts to be gone through

I strongly suggest everyone to go through  **Mathematics for Machine Learning** by Marc Peter Deisenroth , Aldo Faisal and Cheng Soon Ong.
In the present day ,we code all these in python.But in the forthcoming years ,we tend to code in R.Obviously, the languages <br />
will be changing .But the mathematical algorithms never tend to change.It is on which the entire programing framework tend to have laid.<br />
So,it becomes important to go through all this stuffs.<br />

## Probability and Statistics

1.Prabability <br />
2.Measures of Central Tendancy <br />
3.Measures of Dispersion <br />
4.Effect of Outliers <br />
5.Sampling<br />
6.Random Sampling<br />
7.Correlation<br />

The above concepts in P&S is suggested by Sujit and Subhrajit Bhattacharya in their book of Practical Handbook of Machine Learning.<br />
So , on considering all these pre-requisites as roadmap ,let us dive deeper  into the sea of Machine Leaning!!!
